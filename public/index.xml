      <description>Our mission GreenPole is an interdisciplinary research project, committed to decision support for a sustainable use of Nordic forests. We assess trade-offs and synergies between climate, biodiversity and human well-being in policy-making. Our approach is based on a socio-ecological systems understanding and scientific integrity.
and methodology As depicted above, we think of forest governance as a socio-ecological system in which policy interventions affect how people interact with the ecosystem. Here, we consider the outcomes of human land use decisions in terms of extracted timber, carbon storage and habitat quality.</description>
