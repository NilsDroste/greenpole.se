## We are live. 

We are are an interdisciplinary project team working to understand complexities and trade-offs in forest policy making. Please have a look around and get in touch!

We have just build this site and will slowly be starting to populate it. In the meantime, check out our [linkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/greenpole/).

The visual identity is a results of a workshop series with [Research Retold](https://www.researchretold.com/bespoke-identity-building-workshop/). They also designed our beautiful logo, btw.
